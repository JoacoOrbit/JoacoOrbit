# 👋 Hi there, I'm Joaquín

I'm a beginner web developer from Chile, currently learning how the web works — step by step.

## 🚀 What I'm Learning

I'm focusing on:

- 🧱 HTML & CSS  
- ⚙️ JavaScript fundamentals  
- 🎨 UI/UX principles  
- 🛠️ Basic tools like Git, GitHub, and VS Code

I'm learning through a mix of free resources, self-paced study, and government-sponsored courses.

## 🧩 What I Can Do (So Far)

Right now, I'm:

- Reading and editing existing code  
- Recreating simple web pages  
- Practicing how to structure HTML and style with CSS  
- Exploring how JavaScript interacts with the DOM  
- Taking notes and building small things as I go

## 🌱 Goals

- Build beginner-friendly projects (tools, pages, or just experiments)  
- Share my progress and code clearly  
- Learn React once I’m confident with JavaScript  
- Create a personal portfolio to showcase my journey  
- Find my first opportunity in web development

## 📌 Projects Coming Soon

I'll be uploading:

- 🗂️ Mini websites (practice projects)  
- 📋 Simple UI components  
- 🛠️ Useful tools for learners like me  
- 🎨 UX-focused experiments
